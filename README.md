# AmatYr

AmatYr is a personal weather station display software project.

The software is a modern HTML5 "single page app" using JavaScript to fetch data from SQL via JSON from Postgresql + Lua backend. Then the data is transformed into pretty visualizations by the brilliant (D3.js)[http://d3js.org] library, giving the data life!

Primary goal of the project is bringing modern and responsive design, suitable for desktop, tablet and mobile-sized screens. A secondary goal is just playing with new technology because it's fun :-) And I guess a goal is to display some pretty graphs and such for local weather!
